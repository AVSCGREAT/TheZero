<h1>May 27 : Planning</h1>

(A rugged, offline GPS device for hikers, bikers, and adventurers.)
So the thing was I needed a GPS logger for my cycling expeditions (I go like 50kms) and I didn't have a personal phone...so I decided to build the PiTracker

*Sat down and decided on the key features:*

Real-time location from USB GPS module.

Offline maps displayed on the touchscreen.

Log and export routes as GPX files.

Fully portable with battery power.

*Also first list of components:*

USB GPS module (U-blox Neo-6M).

MicroSD card for storing map tiles.

RPI 5 (4gb) / RPI 4 (4gb)

3.5in TFT Touchscreen for RPI

**Time Spent ~ 2hrs**
