<h1>May 27 : Planning</h1>

(A rugged, offline GPS device for hikers, bikers, and adventurers.)

So the thing was I needed a GPS logger for my cycling expeditions (I go like 50kms) and I didn't have a personal phone...so I decided to build the PiTracker

*Sat down and decided on the key features:*

Real-time location from USB GPS module.

Offline maps displayed on the touchscreen.

Log and export routes as GPX files.

Fully portable with battery power.

*Also first list of components:*

USB GPS module (U-blox Neo-6M).

MicroSD card for storing map tiles.

RPI 5 (4gb) / RPI 4 (4gb)

3.5in TFT Touchscreen for RPI

**Time Spent ~ 2hrs** 

## May 26: Modeled the First PiTracker Enclosure

Finished the first version of the 3D enclosure for the PiTracker today!

Designed it in *TinkerCAD*(lol), and exported the STL (attached below). The enclosure is made to fit the Raspberry Pi 3B+ along with the 3.5" TFT screen on top.

###  Design Highlights:
- Cutouts for USB, HDMI, audio jack, and SD card  
- Slots for airflow (still might need more)  
- Mounting space for GPS module and battery (will do that next) 
- Simple slide or screw-together design (haven’t finalized yet)

**Attached:**  
[`rpi 3b+ case.stl`](./rpi%203b%2B%20case.stl)

**Next up:**  
Modify to fit extra parts and airflow — might tweak the tolerances and screen angle after that.

Super hyped to see it come together physically (virtually) soon!

**Time Spent ~ 2.5hrs**
